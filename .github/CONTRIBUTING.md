# Contributing to lightr

There are many ways you can contribute to lightr. All contributions are very 
much welcome and only some of them require technical knowledge. If you have 
something you would like to contribute, but you are not sure how, please don't
hesitate to reach out by opening an 
[issue](https://github.com/ropensci/lightr/issues.) or sending me an email.

## 🗣️ Spreading the word

The easiest (and possibly one of the most useful) way you can contribute to 
lightr is by spreading the word. Please 
[cite it](https://docs.ropensci.org/lightr/CONTRIBUTING.html) in your 
publications and tell your friends and colleagues about it!

## ✍️ Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using
the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.
In other words, please edit a `.R` file in the `R/` folder, and not the `.Rd`
files in the `man/` folder. This is because this package uses 
[roxygen2](https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2) to automatically rebuild the `.Rd`
files.

## 📄 Contributing test files

I am always looking for new test files but ensure that lightr works as expected
for everybody. If you have spectrometry files that you would be willing to 
share, please send me an email. At the very least, I will check if lightr parses
them correctly and if they have unusual features, I will ask you if you agree
that I add them to my continuous integration test suite (on GitHub and on CRAN).

## 😥 Reporting bugs

If you think you found a bug in lightr, even if you're unsure, please let me 
know. The best way is to open an issue on GitHub: 
https://github.com/ropensci/lightr/issues.

Please try to create a [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) with the minimal
amount of code required to reproduce the bug you encountered.

Please also include your session info (e.g. via the R command 
`sessioninfo::session_info()`).

Finally, if your issue relates to the parsing of a specific file, remember to
include said file.

## 🆕 Adding or requesting new parser

If you find a file that lightr cannot open yet, please open an issue or send
me an email with an example file. Some file formats are very complex so I cannot
guarantee that I will be able to quickly provide a parser for all of them but I
will at the very least try.

## 🗳️ Voting for new features

Whenever I can, I open a new issue with the upcoming plans for lightr. If you 
are particularly interested in a specific feature and you would like to help
me prioritise my work, please use 
[the GitHub reactions feature](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/).

## 📖 Code of Conduct

Please note that lightr is released with a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this project
